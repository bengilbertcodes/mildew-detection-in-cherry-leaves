## Deployed App
[Mildew-detection-in-cherry-leaves on heroku](https://powdery-mildew-detector-d26b913cda1a.herokuapp.com/)

## Dataset Content

- The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves).
- The dataset contains 4208 images taken from the client's crop fields. The images show healthy cherry leaves and cherry leaves that have powdery mildew, a fungal disease that affects many plant species. 

## Business Requirements

The cherry plantation crop from Farmy & Foods is facing a challenge where their cherry plantations have been presenting powdery mildew. Currently, the process is manual verification if a given cherry tree contains powdery mildew. An employee spends around 30 minutes in each tree, taking a few samples of tree leaves and verifying visually if the leaf tree is healthy or has powdery mildew. If there is powdery mildew, the employee applies a specific compound to kill the fungus. The time spent applying this compound is 1 minute. The company has thousands of cherry trees located on multiple farms across the country. As a result, this manual process is not scalable due to the time spent in the manual process inspection.

To save time in this process, the IT team suggested an ML system that detects instantly, using a leaf tree image, if it is healthy or has powdery mildew. A similar manual process is in place for other crops for detecting pests, and if this initiative is successful, there is a realistic chance to replicate this project for all other crops. The dataset is a collection of cherry leaf images provided by Farmy & Foods, taken from their crops.

The cherry plantation crop is one of the finest products in their portfolio, and the company is concerned about supplying the market with a compromised quality product.

- 1 - The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a healthy cherry leaf from one with powdery mildew.
- 2 - The client is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.
- 3 - The client is interested in obtaining a prediction report for newly examined leaves.

## Hypothesis and Validation

* Infected leaves display distinct visual features, such as white or grayish powdery spots and curled edges, that differentiate them from healthy leaves.
    - **Validation**: Conduct research about the symptoms borught on by the affects of powdery mildew. Build an average image study to aid the ivestigation and highlight any clear visual indicators of the disease.

* Due to these distinct visual features, the Machine Learning Model with a convolutional neural network (CNN) should be able to accurately classify unseen data (an image of a healthy or infected cherry leaf).

    - **Validation**: Build a machine learning model to evaluate its performance on both training and unseen validation datasets. The process involves the following steps:

        1. **Data Preparation**: Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Preprocess the images (resizing, normalization, and augmentation) to ensure consistency.
        
        2. **Model Architecture**: Design a CNN architecture tailored for image classification. It should include convolutional layers for feature extraction, max pooling for down-sampling, and fully connected layers for classification.
        
        3. **Training**: Train the model using the training dataset, adjusting hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and optimizer (e.g., Adam or Adagrad). Incorporate techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting.
        
        4. **Validation**: Use the validation dataset to monitor the model's performance during training. Evaluate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess how well the model distinguishes between healthy and infected cherry leaves.
        
        5. **Testing and Evaluation**: Once the model is trained, test its performance on the unseen test dataset. The goal is to achieve a high generalization ability with minimal overfitting.
        
        6. **Model Tuning**: Depending on the validation results, fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters or modifying the architecture to improve accuracy and reduce error rates.

        7. **Deployment**: After achieving satisfactory performance, the model can be deployed in a real-world scenario to classify cherry leaves in agricultural environments for disease monitoring and intervention.

## Rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations and ML tasks

### * **Business Requirement 1:** Data Visualisation
> The client is interested in conducting a study to visually differentiate a healthy cherry leaf from one with powdery mildew.

**User Stories**
- As a client I can obtain a fully interactive dashboard so I can view and review the necessary data.
- As a client I can view images that display the differences between an average healthy and infected cherry leaf so I can better understand the differences in displayed symptoms.
- As a client I can view a montage of cherry leaves that are either healthy or unhealthy so that I can better understand the differences in displayed symptoms.

To meet this requirement a Streamlit dashboard will be created and include the following functions:
- Display the "mean" and "standard deviation" images for infected and uninfected cherry leaves.
- Display the difference between average infected and uninfected cherry leaves.
- Display an image montage for either infecetd or uninfected leaves.

### * **Business Requirement 2:** Classification
>The client is interested in predicting if a cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew.

**User Stories**
- As a client I want a ML Model that will predict, with an accuracy of at least 97%, whether a cherry leaf is healthy or displaying symptoms of powdery mildew.

To meet this requirement an ML Model will be built and deployed and the following functionality will be added to the streamlit dashboard:
- An uploader widget will allow the client to upload one or multiple .jpg images. The model will then predict whether the leaf is healthy or showing signs of powdery mildew infection.
- A report of the results will be displayed.


### * **Business Requirement 3:** Reporting
>The client is interested in obtaining a prediction report for newly examined leaves.

**User Stoires**
- As a client I can view and download a report so that I can obtain results of an ML prediction.

To meet this requirement the following functionlality will be added to the streamlit dashboard:
- A report of the results will be displayed.
- A csv version of the report will be downloadable by the client.

## ML Business Case

### Cherry Leaf Powdery Mildew Classifier (Clf)
* We want a machine learning (ML) model to predict whether a leaf is infected with powdery mildew or not based on historical image data. This is a binary classification problem where there are two possible outcomes for each image:
    * **Infected:** Leaf displays signs of powdery mildew infection.
    * **Not infected:** Leaf shows no sign of powdery mildew infection.
* It will be a supervised model, and a 2-class, single-label classification model. This means there are two classes (Infected and Not Infected) and each image can only belong to one class; either Infected or Not Infected, but not both at the same time.
* The ideal outcome would be to provide the client with fast and reliable method of detecting powdery mildew infection.
* The client has agreed that the model sucess metrics are:
    * Accuracy of 97% or above on the test set.
* The model output is designed as a flag, indicating if the cherry leaf is healthy or contains powdery mildew. Staff at the clients facilities will upload pictures to the app and the prediction will be made on the fly.
* Heuristics: The current diagnostic requires staff to conduct a detailed inspection of each tree, taking samples and visually verifying whether signs of powdery mildew are present. This is time consuming and leaves room for diagnostic inaccuracies due to human error.
* The training data to fit the model comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves). The dataset contains 4208 images - 2104 show healthy cherry leaves, 2104 show leaves containing powdery mildew.


## Model Summary
### Summary
The CNN model is structured with three convolutional blocks, followed by dense layers that process increasingly complex features from image input. Regularization techniques like batch normalization, dropout, and L2 regularization help prevent overfitting. The model is compiled for binary classification using categorical crossentropy and the Adagrad optimizer.

### 1. **Convolutional Layers**
   - **Convolutional Block 1**
     - `Conv2D(filters=32, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu')`: 
       - **Filters (32)**: The model uses 32 filters to detect different patterns (e.g., edges, textures) in the input images.
       - **Kernel size (3x3)**: A 3x3 filter size balances detecting small features while preserving spatial context.
       - **Activation ('relu')**: ReLU introduces non-linearity and helps to reduce the vanishing gradient problem.
     - `BatchNormalization()`: Normalizes activations, making training more stable and faster by reducing internal covariate shift.
     - `MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2))`: Reduces spatial dimensions by downsampling, retaining important features and reducing computation.
  
   - **Convolutional Block 2**
     - `Conv2D(filters=64, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu')`: Similar to Block 1, but uses 64 filters to learn more complex features.
     - `BatchNormalization()` and `MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2))`: Serve the same purpose as in Block 1.

   - **Convolutional Block 3**
     - `Conv2D(filters=128, kernel_size=(3,3), activation='relu')`: At this deeper level, 128 filters are used to capture even more complex patterns.
     - `BatchNormalization()` and `MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2,2))`: The same approach is used to normalize and downsample features.

### 2. **Flattening and Fully Connected Layers**
   - `Flatten()`: Converts the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector to prepare data for the dense layers.
   - `Dense(64, activation='relu')`: A fully connected layer with 64 neurons and ReLU activation for non-linearity.
     - **Kernel Regularizer (`l2(0.01)`)**: L2 regularization prevents overfitting by penalizing large weights, promoting simpler models.
   - `Dropout(0.6)`: Drops 60% of the neurons during training to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.

### 3. **Output Layer**
   - `Dense(2, activation='softmax')`: 
     - **Neurons (2)**: The output layer has 2 neurons, indicating a **binary classification** problem.
     - **Activation ('softmax')**: Softmax produces output values as probabilities, appropriate for multi-class or binary classification.

### 4. **Compilation**
   - **Loss ('categorical_crossentropy')**: Suitable for multi-class classification tasks, even for binary classification.
   - **Optimizer ('adagrad')**: Adagrad adjusts the learning rate dynamically for each parameter, used here to compare performance in smaller dataset.
   - **Metrics ('accuracy')**: Accuracy is used to monitor the model's performance during training and evaluation.
